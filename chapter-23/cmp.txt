if (strcmp(str, "foo") == 0 || strcmp(str, "baz") == 0 || strcmp(str, "bar") == 0)

if (strstr(str, "foo baz bar")) WRONG

Essentially, instead of trying to find "foo baz bar" in the str, we set the 
str to be the search term. So it will try to find the part of the str
that is in "foo#bar#baz" and if does returns a pointer. This means that if 
"foo" was in the str it would match. The '#' acts as a delimiter so we dont
have partial matches for example, if the str had "foobar". Thats why we assume
that the str does not have the # character and is at least 3 characters long
for a match to even be possible.


Answer:
if (strstr("foo#bar#baz", str) != NULL) â€¦

The assumptions are that str is at least three characters long and doesn't contain the # character.
